Formulate the system of equations in matrix form, i.e. $A_h u = b_h$. Take care with the boundary conditions. Define a linear mapping $R: \mathbb{R}^5 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ according to the full weighting scheme.</description></item><item><title>Finite Differences</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/exercises/finite-differences/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/exercises/finite-differences/</guid><description>Finite Differences # Consider the one-dimensional Poisson equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions $$-\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2}=f(x),~~~x\in(0,1)$$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions $$u(0)=u(1) = 0.$$
Discretise the Poisson equation by finite differences using an equidistant mesh size $h=1/N$ and $N+1$ grid points. Write the finite difference approximation from 1. in matrix-vector form $Au=b$. Therefore, define the entries of the matrix $A\in\mathbb{R}^{N+1\times N+1}$. Write the finite difference approximation as $Au=b$, where $A\in\mathbb{R}^{N-1\times N-1}$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}^{N-1}$, by substituting the values for $u(0)$ and $u(1)$.</description></item><item><title>Two-Grid Iteration</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/exercises/two-grid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/exercises/two-grid/</guid><description>Fourier Analysis for Two-Grid Iteration # You can find the exercise in the following ipython notebook: ipython notebook</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/exercises/norms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/exercises/norms/</guid><description>If you find yourself confused by the norms used in the lecture work through this notebook on norms:
