    "# Fourier Analysis for Two-Grid Iteration\n",
    "We stick to the Poisson example:\n",

    "This time, however, we want to consider the more general case of having $N+1$ grid points, where $N:=2K$, and a resulting mesh size $h:=1/N$.\n",
    "A step towards multigrid methods consists in the  two-grid method based on coarse-grid correction.\n",
    "In this particular case, we formulate the algorithm as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After some iteration steps using a smoother (like Jacobi), compute residual $r^{old}:= b^h-A_h u^h$. The residual and the error $e^{old}$ fulfill the residual equation $r^{old}=A e^{old}$.\n",
    "2. Restrict the residual to the coarse grid using an operator $R$. This yields a (residual-like) vector $r^{2h}$ on the coarse grid. The coarse grid is assumed to have $K+1$ points.\n",
    "3.  Solve the residual equation $A_{2h} e^{2h} = r^{2h}$ on the coarse grid. $A_{2h}$ corresponds to the coarse-grained system that resembles $A_h$ on the fine grid.\n",
    "4. Interpolate the resulting coarse-grid approximation of the error $e^{2h}$ to the fine grid and correct the fine-grid error $e^{new}:=e^{old}-Pe^{2h}$. The interpolation operator shall be denoted by $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we define vectors $q_h^m$ with components $(q_{h}^m)_i:=\\sin(m\\pi h i)$. With respect to the fine grid, we have a low frequency if $m<N/2$, and a high frequency if $m\\geq N/2$.\\newline\n",
    "In the following, we want to step through the Fourier analysis for this method and investigate the convergence behaviour, considering one cycle of this two-grid algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Give a closed expression for $e^{new}$ which only depends on $e^{old}$ and not on $e^{2h}$ anymore. You may use the operators $R$, $P$, $A_{2h}$ and $A_h$ from above.\n",
    "2. Define the restriction operator $R$ by injection. Show that the restriction of any error frequency $R q_h^m$ yields a low frequency, that is\n",
