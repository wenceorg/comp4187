I have been informed by CIS that the room was stil being set up when we used it, as a result the encore recording does not have sound. This should be fixed for future lectures. For this one the extensive notes included in the jupyter notebook will hopefully be sufficient. Any questions just ask by email or in the next lecture.</description></item><item><title>Lecture 2: Time-stepping</title><link>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/lectures/numerics/lecture2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://teaching.wence.uk/comp4187/lectures/numerics/lecture2/</guid><description>Lecture 2 # The jupyter notebook containing the lecture content can be found at:
